### Description

Shows how to control the Windows Media Encoder SDK through Code, not like the other submissions on this Site through a Batch-File or something like that. Encodes a given Video-File by using a Profile from the Windows Media Encoder which you choose (or you can also create an ew Profile through the Profile Manager).

NOTE THAT THIS REQUIRES THE WINDOWS MEDIA ENCODER 9 TO BE INSTALLED !!! This can be downloaded from the Microsoft-Website !

Credits go to Steve McMahon for his Progressbar, and two people whose names i cannot remember, for the "Progressbar Remaining Time" - Module and the Common Dialog API, so if you recognize your code, please post in the comments so I can give you your well deserved Credit !
